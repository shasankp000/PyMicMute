# Features

1. Simple to use
2. Cool UI (for a python app that is)
3. App has a resilient settings feature which works against input device crashes or power cuts, after such an event when the app is restarted or the input device is re-connected, the app will remember what state the mic was in previously and automatically mute or un-mute the mirophone.
4. Works across any meeting app/multiplayer game that uses a mic.


> Note: I made this app for a friend to solve a problem, but anyone can now use it :)
